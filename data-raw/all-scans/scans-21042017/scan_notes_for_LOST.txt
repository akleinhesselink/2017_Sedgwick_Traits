Scanned leaves are numbered from top to bottom. 

Scans from P1 to P4 had some weight error so for scans from P5 to P8 we did a pooled scan of many leaflets at once.  The number of leaflets is recorded on the envelope and on the datasheet in the notes. 

Re-processed the leaf scans for leaves 1-4 on 01/21/2020. 

Re-weighed the leaflets for leaves 1-4 on 01/21/2020.  Lumped the three leaflets together for sample leaves #1-3 to get a total weight for the sample.
