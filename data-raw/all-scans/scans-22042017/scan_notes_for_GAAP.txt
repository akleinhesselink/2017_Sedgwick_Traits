Weighing three leaves at once to reduce weighing error.  Each triplet from a single whorl.  Weighing and scanning each rep of three separately.  Scans are #1,2,3 from top to bottom of scanned image. 

Re-scanned on 1-22-20 because some of the leaf areas were inconsistent and there was wide variance in SLA.
